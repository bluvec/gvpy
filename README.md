**Gvpy** is short from **G**o **V**isits **PY**thon.

Gvpy provides scalable high-level APIs to call python codes from golang. Compared to [go-python3]([go-python3](https://github.com/DataDog/go-python3)) which provides the low-level golang bindings for the C-API of cpython, gvpy is easier to use and memory safer due to the help of golang garbage collector. Moreover, the _numpy_ package is also supported by gvpy.

**NOTES**
* Gvpy only supports python3.
* Gvpy is still under heavy development. Every API is subject to change before stable.
